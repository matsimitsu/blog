%p Yesterday we made an attempt to visit Mt. Hiei, but the timing didn't work out, by the time we would be at the top, the last cablecar down the mountain would have departed. Time for a re-match, but not before having a delicious bowl of noodles. After the noodles we had to walk 2 kilometers uphill to get to the cable car.
