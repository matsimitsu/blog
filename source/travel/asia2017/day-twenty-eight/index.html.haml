%p In the morning we visited an arcade called Atana No Warehouse. It's a game arcade themed to the Kowloon Walled City. They replicated hallways, apartments and other features of the famous city to the smallest details. Unfortunately we weren't allowed to take more photo's then the ones below.

%p After the warehouse we took the train to Todoroki Station where we visited Todoroki Ravine, a nice part of nature in a big city.
