%p After a very short night's sleep, because of the delays yesterday, we headed out to explore Hong Kong. First stop: Hong Kong Park.

%p The park offers a great view of Hong Kong and has an Aviary where you can walk around freely.

%p Hong Kong has a great subway system that is clean, fast and efficient.

%h2 Ngong Ping
%p In our case it took us to the end of a line, where we took the cable car to Ngong Ping.

%p The cable car is one of the longest in the world and takes you literally in the clouds.

%p That was kind of a problem for us, as it was really hard to see the thing we came to see. The giant buddha statue.

%p Luckily there was more to see then just the statue, also there was beer :)

%p The rest of the day we just wandered around a bit. Looking for Apple Watches and cheap mobile phones in the various malls.
