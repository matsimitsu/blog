%p We had a slow start today, because we had to book the trips to Ha Long Bay and Sa Pa for the next few days. When we got out the door it was already 15:30, not that this matters, it's still 35 degrees celcius.

  The temple was built in 1070 and was reconstructed a bunch of times, the last one in 2000.
