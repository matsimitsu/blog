  It's hot, it's humid, it's messy, it's busy, it's loud, it's Bangkok! Armed with a list of temples we wanted to visit, we headed to the end of the subway line and walked to the first wat (temple), Wat Traimit.

%p The final wat of our tour was Bavorn Niwet. We had rented a TukTuk for 50 Thai Baht to take us to these three temples.

%p With the TukTuk driver getting tired of us (he kept trying to drop us off at suit stores, so he would get a commission, we didn't need a suit), we walked from Bavorn Niwet to the river to get the water taxi to our last temple.

%p On our way to the river we came across this fort, Pom Pra Sumen. Built in 1783 to defend against potential naval invasions.

%p The water taxi was a refreshing experience. A couple of minutes not beeing surrounded by gas fumes and moped/tuktuk noises was bliss. It took us to our last temple of the day: Wat Pho.
