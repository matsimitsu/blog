%p Today is a Sunday, this means there will be crowds at the touristy places. A perfect time to visit Ueno Park.

%p In the park there was a market with food and music that attracted the attention of most people there. This seemed an excellent opportunity to head to the temple and avoid the crowds.

%p There are tons of things to do at Ueno park, with a Zoo and Museums, but the place was packed, so I headed into the nearby neighborhood of Taito where things were much calmer.

%p With aparently was a very popular train-spotting place judging by the amount of people with camera's mounted in tripods pointed at the tracks. So why not join in the fun :).
