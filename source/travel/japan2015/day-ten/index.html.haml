%p Still tired from the few days before and with some work to do I decided to mostly stay in for today. The rain didn't help either. At around 16:00 I felt like taking a quick trip trough the neighborhood, since the rain had died down a bit.

%p My goal was to follow the river.

%p I like how, despite the lack of space, most residents still try to place as many plants in front of their house as possible.

%p As usual I ended up in a shopping district around a station (Jujo station).

%p As you can see, by this time the rain was pouring down again, so I took the trains back to my hotel.
