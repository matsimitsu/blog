%p With no set goal today, I just started wandering the neighborhoods in the area of my hotel.

%p Japan's zoning laws <a href="http://urbankchoze.blogspot.jp/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html" target="_blank">are pretty cool</a>. Explained very basic: they can only zone upwards and "higher" zones will always include all zones below. E.g. Low density > High Density > Commercial > Industrial. Basically the thing zoned is nuisance level. This makes for very interesting neighborhoods.

%p As space is scarce in Tokyo, every nook and cranny is used for something. For example the two shops under the train tracks.

%p Just a stone's throw away from one of the highest structures in the world (The Tokyo SKYTREE) lies a calm residential neighborhood. You can see the SKYTREE structure in the background.

%p It's customary for new residents of a building to tear it down and replace it with their own (new) built home. This makes for a great mix of building ages.

%p Over time the number of passengers increased and the trains became longer and longer. Now they almost don't fit the station building anymore.

%p
  \- We should place cones here to show this passage is dangerous.
  %br
  \- How many?
  %br
  \- All of them!
  (This is only one hallway of the 5, stretching several hundred meters)
