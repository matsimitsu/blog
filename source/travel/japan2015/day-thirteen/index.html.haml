%p Today I traded in the concrete jungle for a rock in the ocean called "Fujisawa". From where you'd supposedly have a great view of Mt. Fuji (That I still havent' seen yet). It takes about 1.5 hours to get there from Tokyo.

%p It takes about half an hour to cross the Island (you have to go over the top with lots of climbing), but the view on the other side is amazing.

%p After two trips it finally happened, for once Mt. Fuji wasn't covered in clouds.

%p The island itself has a few temples/shrines and lots of places to eat.

%p After returning from the island I took a small train along the coast. I checked TripAdvisor to see if anything interesting was near, and it came up with this giant Buddha statue.

%p The sign near the statue said there was a trail to the next train station, with still an hour of daylight to spare, I decided to take the hike.
