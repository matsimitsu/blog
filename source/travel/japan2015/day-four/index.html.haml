%p Of all the places in the world my colleague Wes decided to visit Tokyo at the same time as me. So we decided to hang out for a day, starting in Harajuku.

%p It was raining today and most of the view is blocked by a gazillion umbrella's.

%p After a nice stroll to Shibuya were we ate delicious Okonomiyaki we headed to Akihabara to do some KitKat shopping (I ended up with KitKat Cheesecake flavor, they are delicious) and play a few games in the many arcades there.
