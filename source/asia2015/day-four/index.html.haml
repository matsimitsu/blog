%p Haw Par Villa is a former amusement park that is now free for the public to visit. It displays a number of Chinese tales about good and evil with puppets. Part of the park is a tunnel with the 10 stages of hell a bad person has to go through.

%p The characters are totally random and vary between rabbits, people and bears.

%p The park is really strange and most parts are badly maintained.

%p Fortunately they started restoring the park by re-painting all the displays.

%p After the park we headed back to the subway to go to Sentosa Island.

%p This the entertainment island with Universal studios, beaches, water parks and pretty much every other form of entertainment you can imagine.

%p We settled with just visiting the beach. In the background you can see hundreds of ships anchored, waiting for a job. On the other side of the cable car is Mount Faber. It offers a nice view of the city.

%p The evening was setting in, it was time for our final evening in Singapore. We headed to the Gardens at the Bay, a giant park near the waterfront. One of the attractions is an indoor "Cloud walk" where you walk down a giant mountain covered with plants.

%p Outside are the most know features of the park, Giant towers covered in plants and emitting lights. You can take a skywalk between the towers, but we got there too late to buy tickets. Fortunatley a nice man approached us and gave his tickets so we were the last to take the walk that day.

%p We ended the day in our home-base, Chinatown, with a nice drink.
